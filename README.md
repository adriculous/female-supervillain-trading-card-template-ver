# Female SuperVillain Trading Card App (Template Version)
This is an interactive Female Supervillain trading card app. It is a small database of custom-designed trading cards of original supervillain female characters. Users can add or remove any trading card into their database.

### Features and Skills
- Powered by Flask microframework
- SQLAlchemy module imported to automatically add trading card entries into a SQL database
- HTML templates templated using Jinja
- Used standard modules such as datetime

### Future Plans
I'll probably use this app as a template for building different types of trading card apps with different themes for practice, such as those related to my current J-Pop (Japanese Pop) fandoms. Once I get better with python and Flask, I may add more features that would make the trading card app more complete.
